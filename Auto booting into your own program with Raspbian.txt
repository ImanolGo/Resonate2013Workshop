This is a quick and dirty way to get your Pi to run a particular piece of software on boot. A better way will involve cron or something similar to make sure the software is always running and the hardware watchdog.

But let's start with this for now, this has only been tested with Raspbian.

First we need the system to boot into a command prompt without requiring a password, so from the command line run:

sudo nano /etc/inittab

Then change the line:

1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty --noclear 38400 tty1

Into:

1:2345:respawn:/bin/login -f root tty1 </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1

Now we are going to launch the program every time the system has finished booting, so do:
sudo nano /etc/profile

Add the path of your program to the bottom, for instance:
/home/root/openFrameworks/apps/RaspberryPiWorkshop/GenerativeExample/bin/GenerativeExample 

Todo: The Pi can still go to sleep, merge the tip here about preventing sleep mode:
